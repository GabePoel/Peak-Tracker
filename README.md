# Peak Tracker

Documentation is currently a work in progress. But, program should be relatively intuitive to use at this point without every feature listed. Run the 'run.py' program to start Peak Tracker. Then proceed to select a folder that contains all the relevant tdms files as the import folder. The export folder will default to creating a new folder in your local Documents directory.

After you have data imported, you can select it manually. Left click to select a point where the Lorentzian's peak is. Right click and drag to select default amplitude and width parameters. Press space to commit your selection and it should turn green. Press enter/return when you're ready to start tracking.

To edit any of the tracking, fitting, export, debugging, or any other criteria, tweak them in 'modularConfig.py' These _will_ ultimately all be documented in full. But, we're not quite there yet I'm afraid.

## Basics/How to Use

Peak Tracker comes with a pre-loaded set of data to experiment with before plugging in your own. Before you load up your own RUS data and get frustrated trying to figure out how to make Peak Tracker work, it's recommended that you follow along with this guide which goes through the basics of how to use Peak Tacker with this initialized default data.

To start Peak Tracker, run the 'run.py' file in the Peak-Tracker directory. It should pull up a window that looks something like the following.
